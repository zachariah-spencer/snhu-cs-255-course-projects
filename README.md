# DriverPass Online Drivers Education System - System Design & Business Requirements Documentation
### Southern New Hampshire University - Computer Science 255 - Course Final Projects

## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
For the purposes of this assignment, I worked for a small consulting company that designs systems for various clients. My project lead had assigned me to a new client, DriverPass. DriverPass noticed that there are very few tools that train students to pass their driving tests. Their research has found that more than 65% of the students applying for the driving license exam fail since all they did was study previous tests! DriverPass wanted to provide students with access to online practice exams and on-the-road training to better prepare them for driving tests. DriverPass hired my consulting company to assist in designing a system that can handle these needs.

## What did you do particularly well?
I reviewed a transcript of the initial interview between my co-workers and key members of the DriverPass leadership team. I interpreted the needs and requirements for a prospective online solution that DriverPass was seeking from the interview, then I created a detailed business requirements document that clearly communicates those needs that DriverPass has for a new online system.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
My system design document did not include simple explanations for the various UML diagrams I had included. If I was given the chance to revise my mistakes, I would include a detailed but easy to understand explanation alongside each diagram. This would improve the document's accessibility for non-technical readers which would improve team communication throughout the project.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
In order to understand the user's needs, I first carefully reviewed both the DriverPass interview transcript as well as my business requirements document. I then developed use cases and corresponding diagrams to better understand and visualize the user's needs. I then translated these needs into feasible features for the website. Prioritizing the user’s needs is crucial, as they are the ones interacting with the product. If the product doesn't meet their expectations or provide a positive experience, they are less likely to engage, purchase, or consider other products from the same company.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
My approach to software design is to front-load the majority of the planning before beginning development, then to iterate on that plan alongside development as the needs of the project evolve organically. This approach, when followed carefully, can be used to create complex software applications of all shapes and sizes. Some strategies I will use in future software analysis and design include interviewing client's to determine what they value out of a new system, creating a business requirements document, writing up a software design document, and decomposing broad software requirements into specific use cases. I will also create UML use case, sequence, activity, and class diagrams as necessary to better understand the different ways the system will be utilized and how the system's various entities will communicate. Once development begins, another technique I may use to ensure that my code is kept clean, robust, and scalable would be to first utilize pseudocode to ensure the logic of my design makes sense. As I begin implementing my design, I would also take note of any code that may be refactorable and would continue this as an iterative process until the code was satisfactory.
